            <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They allow the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you donâ€™t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.</p>

            <p><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.

            <p>Hopefully, that has clarified things for you. As was previously mentioned, if there is something that you aren't sure whether you need or not, it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does interact with one of the features you use on our site.</p>
